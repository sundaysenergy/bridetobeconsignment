### What is Consignment?

Consignment is a great way to sell all of your used and new items you no longer need from your wedding or event.  We take in everything that has to do with wedding decorations and formal wear.  Bride to be Consignments contract is 90 days, the first 60 your item is sold at full price and the last 30 days you items are sold at Â½ price.  During this time when your item sells, you receive 50% of the sale price.  You can call any time to check on your account and also request a check.  After 90 days, if your item do not sell and you do not pick them up, they become property of Bride To Be Consignment and may be donated to a local charity.

### What will we take on Consignment?

If you used it in your wedding, most likely another bride would love to use it too!  we do ask that all items are cleaned before they come to the store for sale.  Dresses and formal wear must be clean and stain free.  Wedding dresses will be accepted in a preservation box for consignment.  we will only take dresses that are in current style.  This is about 6 years and newer.  Every brand is accepted at Bride To Be Consignment!
Items not accepted at this time on consignment are two piece wedding dresses and some bridesmaid dresses.
